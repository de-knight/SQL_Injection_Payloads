    <tr>
      <td>In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi)</td>
      <td>In-band SQL Injection is the most common and straightforward type of attack. It occurs when the attacker uses the same communication channel to both inject malicious SQL queries and retrieve results. The two primary forms of in-band SQLi are Error-based SQLi and Union-based SQLi, both of which allow attackers to quickly gain insights or manipulate the database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Error-based SQLi</td>
      <td>This technique relies on error messages returned by the database server. The attacker can exploit these errors to gather information about the database structure, which might be enough to enumerate entire tables or databases without further exploitation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Union-based SQLi</td>
      <td>Union-based SQL Injection leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements into a single response. This technique enables attackers to retrieve multiple sets of data in one go by embedding malicious SQL queries into the original request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi)</td>
      <td>Inferential SQL Injection is a more subtle attack method, where attackers dont directly retrieve data. Instead, they infer information based on the behavior of the database and application. Though it is slower than in-band SQLi, inferential SQLi is just as potent. It’s commonly called “blind SQL Injection” because the attacker receives no visible feedback. However, by sending specific queries and observing the applications response, the attacker can reconstruct the underlying database structure. There are two types: Boolean-based Blind SQLi and Time-based Blind SQLi.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Boolean-based (Content-based) Blind SQLi</td>
      <td>In this technique, the attacker sends a query that forces the application to return different content based on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE value. By observing changes or no changes in the content of the HTTP response, attackers can determine the validity of their SQL query and infer information from the database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Time-based Blind SQLi</td>
      <td>Time-based Blind SQL Injection relies on the databases response time to indicate whether a query is valid. The attacker sends a query that forces the database to wait for a specified period before responding. If the response is delayed, the attacker knows the query returned TRUE; if it’s immediate, the result is FALSE. This technique allows attackers to extract data even when no information is returned by the application.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Out-of-band SQLi</td>
      <td>Out-of-band SQL Injection is less common, as it relies on database features that aren’t always available. It occurs when the attacker uses a different channel for sending malicious queries and retrieving results, unlike in-band SQLi. This technique is particularly useful when in-band attacks are unreliable due to server instability or when features such as HTTP responses are delayed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Voice-Based SQL Injection</td>
      <td>Voice-Based SQL Injection targets systems that interact with databases through voice commands. In this method, an attacker could exploit voice input systems by issuing malicious SQL queries through spoken commands, allowing unauthorized access to the database. As voice-controlled applications become more popular, this vector could potentially open new avenues for attackers.</td>
